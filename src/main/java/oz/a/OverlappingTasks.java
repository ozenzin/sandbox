/*
Define a task had a starting time and end time, each task need to be executed in one slot(like a CPU).
Given a list of tasks, at least how many execution slots are needed?

Example 1:
Input: [[0, 30],[5, 10],[15, 20]]
Output: 2
Example 2:
Input: [[7,10],[2,4]]
Output: 1

/*
My algorithm:
1. Put all tasks in sorted map (STM) keyed on start time.
2. Create a list of tasks (TL) -empty at the start.
3. Iterate through map STM, and
  a) take start time of current task, and compare it with end time of each task in the list TL: IF latter is less THEN remove task from TL;
  b) add current task to TL; go to next task in STM.
4. At the end, TL will have all tasks, and size of TL will be the answer.
Time complexity: O(N lg N) for sorting, and O(N) for iterating through STM. Space complexity: O(N) for STM and TL.
